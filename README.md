In this project, we implemented a 4 bit processor, using components; program counter, instruction memory, register file, 4-bit ALU and a control unit. All of these components were tied using a Datapath, which was implemented inside a module of CPU. The goal was to implement instructions that are;  AND, OR, addition, subtraction, set-less-than, branch-equal-to, and branch-not-equal. We also implemented flags; carry_flag, overflow_flag, and zero_flag. Zero flag was implemented because of its importance in BEQ and BNE instructions.
